# üîç SPECIFIC DIAGNOSTIC FOR YOUR API KEY

## Your Configuration
- **API Key**: 0a7f3e9406msh5385ead16268ba6p196e5ejsn196d4ea2ccb2
- **API URL**: https://twitter-api45.p.rapidapi.com  
- **Endpoint**: /search.php
- **Status**: You say you're subscribed but getting "not subscribed" errors

## üö® LIKELY ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

### 1. Subscription Status Mismatch
**Problem**: RapidAPI shows you're subscribed, but API returns subscription errors
**Possible Causes**:
- Subscription recently created (not yet activated)
- Free tier limits reached
- Payment method issues
- API provider configuration problems

**Immediate Checks**:
- Visit your [RapidAPI Dashboard](https://rapidapi.com/developer/billing)
- Check if payment method is valid
- Verify subscription is "Active" not just "Subscribed"
- Look for any billing alerts

### 2. API Key Permissions
**Problem**: API key doesn't have proper permissions
**Solutions**:
- Try regenerating your API key in RapidAPI dashboard
- Make sure you're using the correct key (not test key)
- Check if key has been revoked or expired

### 3. Endpoint URL Issues
**Problem**: Wrong endpoint or parameters
**The diagnostic tool will test**:
- `/search.php` (your main endpoint)
- `/search` (alternative)
- `/timeline.php` (different endpoint)
- Different parameter formats

### 4. Request Format Problems
**Problem**: API expects different headers or parameters
**The tool tests**:
- Different parameter names (query vs q vs search)
- Various header combinations
- GET vs POST requests

- What's the exact error message?

### Step 3: Run Full Diagnostic
Click "Run All Tests" to try every combination:
- Multiple endpoints
- Different parameter formats  
- Various query styles

### Step 4: Analyze Results
- Count how many tests succeeded vs failed
- Look for patterns in errors
- Note if ANY test succeeds

### Step 5: Check Subscription
If ALL tests fail with subscription errors:
1. Go to [RapidAPI Dashboard](https://rapidapi.com/developer/apps)
2. Click on your app
3. Check "Subscriptions" tab
4. Verify Twitter API45 is listed and "Active"
5. Check billing status

### Step 6: Contact RapidAPI Support

### Scenario 3: API Provider Issue
- All tests fail with 500/server errors
- Solution: Try again later or contact API provider
- Consider using alternative Twitter API

### Scenario 4: Everything Works
- Tests succeed and show tweet data
- Problem was in main app implementation
- Use working code from diagnostic tool

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS

1. **Run the diagnostic tool immediately**
2. **Screenshot all results**
3. **Based on results, follow appropriate solution**
4. **Report back with specific error messages**
