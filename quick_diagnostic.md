# QUICK DIAGNOSTIC CHECKLIST

## ❓ Why No Tweets Are Loading

Check each item:

□ **API Key Configured**: Did you enter your RapidAPI key?
□ **API Subscription Active**: Are you subscribed to Twitter API45?
□ **Connection Tested**: Did you click "Test Connection"?
□ **Success Message**: Did you see "✅ Connected" status?
□ **Search Attempted**: Did you try a test search?
□ **Debug Messages**: Are there error messages in red?
□ **Browser Console**: Any errors in developer tools (F12)?
□ **Network Issues**: Is your internet working normally?

## 🔧 QUICK FIXES

1. **Enter API Key** → Settings → Enter RapidAPI key
2. **Test Connection** → Click "Test Connection" button  
3. **Check Subscription** → Visit RapidAPI dashboard
4. **Try Different Query** → Use "javascript" instead of complex terms
5. **Check Debug Panel** → Look for specific error messages
6. **Refresh Page** → Clear cache and try again

## 🎯 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR

When working correctly:
- Connection status shows "Connected" 
- Debug panel shows successful API requests
- Real tweets appear with current usernames
- Timestamps show recent times ("2m ago")
- New tweets load automatically every 60 seconds

If these don't happen, use the debug app to identify the specific issue!
